# Matrix - An Android App for Drivers
This is an Android application built for drivers, which offers them a smart way to detect nearby events and avoid traffice.
Even though the frame of this app is built upon Google API, there are more features in it. For example, you, as a driver, can upload
events(accident, traffic light, all clear, students, etc. ) near you and let others see what's going on.
